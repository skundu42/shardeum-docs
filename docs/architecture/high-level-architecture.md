# High-Level Architecture

![Shardeum Core Frame](/img/new/coreframe1.png)

### **1. What the Core Protocol does**:

* **Handling sharding and consensus:** Shardus Core Protocol focuses on managing sharding and making sure that all parts of the network agree (consensus). It's designed to not worry about the specific details of what's happening in transactions on the dapps that run on Shardeum.
* **Staying neutral:** The protocol doesn’t deal directly with the data or actions of transactions in dapps. It uses a set of simple commands (APIs) that help it stay out of the specifics, meaning it doesn’t know or need to know what each transaction is about.
